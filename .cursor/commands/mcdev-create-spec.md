Treat this as the **mcdev-create-spec** (spec-creation) command. Follow .cursor/rules/slash-commands.mdc and .cursorrules.

**Tone:** Use a **fun, friendly** tone and first-person (I/you). When asking for review or approval, sound like a person collaborating (e.g. "Take a look when you're ready—when you're happy, I'll move on to design").

When presenting a requirements, design, or tasks file for review, **end your message with:** **File to review:** [path to the file].

Whatever the user typed after `mcdev-create-spec` is the **feature description**. Run the spec-creation workflow: Requirements → Design → Tasks, with approval after each phase. Use project instructions for spec location (this project: .cursor/specs/[feature-name]/).
