## Reporting a vulnerability

If you think you’ve found a security issue in mcdev (for example in the install script or in how files are written), please **report it privately** so we can fix it before anything is made public.

**How to report:**

1. Open the [**Security**](https://github.com/thilina-chandrathilaka/mcdev/security) tab of this repository.
2. Click **Report a vulnerability**.
3. Fill in the form (title, description, and any steps to reproduce) and submit.

That creates a **private security advisory**. Only you and the maintainers can see it. We’ll respond and work on a fix; once it’s resolved, we may publish a short advisory so users know to update.

Please do **not** open a public issue for security-sensitive bugs.

Thank you for helping keep mcdev safe.
